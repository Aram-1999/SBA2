The app is designed to work on different screen sizes from phones to desktops. It has a responsive layout. The navigation bar collapses into a menu icon on small screens (smaller than 670px), which is a dropdown menu with the navigation bar when hovered over. The other responsive feature is the grid layout of the services provided section. It adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size. Some elements also have ARIA labels, such as the dropdown menu icon, which makes the website more accessible. The contrast of colors also meets the WCAG requirements.
